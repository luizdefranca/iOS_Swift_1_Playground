 ## Protocols
 Protocols are a defined contract or blueprint that a class, struct or enum must follow.

 Here we define a 'ShapeProtocol' where anything that conforms to it must provide a property of number of sides and a function called 'shapeDescription'

 - Experiment:
 Add a new function in our 'ShapeProtocol' that should calculate the area of its shape. Make sure you implement it in our 'Square' class as well.
 */

/*:
 - Experiment:
 Add a new property in our 'ShapeProtocol' of type String that indicates the colour of this shape.

 - Experiment:
 We can also declare a custom initializer within our 'ShapeProtocol' that any class must have present. Create an initializer that takes in a colour as a parameter.

 Define a person protocol with name, gender, age and add a custom initializer to set all the properties and a function to print a description of this person. Create a 'Student' class that conforms to this protocol and print the description of this student using its name.

 ## Extensions
 Extensions are a way to add additional functions to an existing class, struct or enum.
 \
 For example, I can extend the `'Double'` class to add a function I may use very often such as squaring a number. ie: 4*4 = 16
 
 - Note:
 Extensions are like categories from Objective-C. Unlike Objective-C categories, Swift extensions do not have names.

 Try adding the 'square' function to the `Float` type
